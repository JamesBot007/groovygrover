    "Search applications, especially for unsorted data, are limited by the number of elements N. To find a specific element with a probability of 50%, any classical algorithm has to access the database a minimum of 0.5N times. However, in the worst case, N times are required if the last evaluation leads to the correct member. Thus, classical computation cannot solve the problem in fewer than $\\displaystyle{O(N)}$ evaluations.<br>\n",
    "Quantum mechanics can speed up a range of search applications over unsorted data. Quantum mechanical systems can be in a superposition of states and simultaneously examine multiple elements. By properly adjusting the phases of various operations, successful computations reinforce each other while others interfere randomly. As a result, the desired element can be obtained in only  $\\displaystyle{O(\\sqrt{N})}$ accesses to the database. "
